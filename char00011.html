    <p><strong>Description: </strong> A nice, posh business owner who knows how to get down to business. While he does love to run his businesses, he also has a few hobbies on the side(namely, eating ungodly/unearthly amounts of food, mostly consisting of cheese wiz). He controls much of the economy of the archipelago, Besides the Benc Co, Ench Inc, 10 hour burst energy, that one food truck, and Beta Tech, with a few more that we cannot list. He is the head of Misilata, while also owning the majority of stocks in Kekellime. He has amassed a fortune over the years, but refuses to share any of it with the islands due to ’financial reasons’  and apologizes to the residents for this. Nobody really believes him though. Behind closed doors, he is really full of himself. Always bragging to some of his friends about how wealthy and powerful he is, and often flaunts stacks of cash in front of minimum wage workers under his employment. He is currently trying to expand his reach over the region, trying to get the secret recipe everyone is looking for. Many lawsuits have been filed against this man for many Product liability, human rights, and safety violations but as of now, none of them have been successful due to his professional team of lawyers.</p> 
    <p>“I do not agree with any negative statements about me, it is simply outrageous that anyone would think such things about a noble man such as I.” - Big Cheese</p>
    <p><strong>Fun fact! Many minimum wage workers under his employment don’t get breaks at all, even if it is to catch their breath.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Fun Fact! There will be a grease fire in hell when he burns</strong></p>
