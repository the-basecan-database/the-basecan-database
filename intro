<h1>About The Basecan Database</h1>
  <p>Hello, new user, and welcome to the Basecan Database! I'm sure you already had a lot of questions before you even clicked on this guide: "What is this slide about?", "Where do I start reading?", "How do I write a Basecan?", "What is IKEIAKEA?", "How do you pronounce IKEIAKEA?"</p>
  <p>To spare you all the trouble of having to navigate blindly through over ten pages of content, this introduction aims to answer as many of these questions as we can, hopefully without taking too much time.</p>
