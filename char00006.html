    <p><em>“Food truck guy my beloved”</em></p>
  </div>

  <div id="desc" class="desc">
    <p><strong>Description: </strong> He was born at night, but not last night! Despite his name, he HATES delectable food. He prefers food from that one suspicious food truck he found in an alleyway when he was two, and if exposed to any food that is not from the food truck, he enters a rage induced psychosis for exactly twenty-seven minutes and fifty-five seconds. “Livin that thug life”, he claims, as he goes about trashing offices and spreading garbage on windows as hobbies.</p>
    
    <p>He often likes to ridicule people he likes, making it hard to be his friend. The only person he doesn’t do this to is Clara Lobotomy, who is his childhood friend (unless he is calm..). Other times, when he’s more agreeable, is a chill guy, claiming his ‘wild self’ is not him and an ‘impostor to his inner mind and soul, not really liking his predicament in the current moment’.</p>

    <p>He likes to wear clothes from thrift stores as his mother taught him to do, but he usually abandons those before the next day arrives while working wherever he feels like it. Having a childhood that could be regarded as ‘suspicious’ in it’s own right, he claims he is normal. But is that really the case?</p>
    <p>(He also thinks 55 is 64, do not trust this man.)</p>
